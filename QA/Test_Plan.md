## A. Introduction

### A.1. Purpose of the document

This document describes the test plan for the fifth ALGOSUP project which is about algorithmics.The software's main focus is on stage 4 of the champagne-making process, which is blending.

### A.2. Purpose of the Software
The purpose of the software is to blend large quantities of wine in the right proportions, according to a pre-determined formula. The software should produce the closest result to the input formula with the minimum number of steps.


## B. Objectives

The main objectives of this test plan are to ensure that:

- The software is correct and does not crash during operation.
- The software produces a result that is as close as possible to the input formula.
- The software is well-documented and follows good coding practices.
- The software achieves the desired result in the minimum number of steps.
- The software is efficient and performs its tasks quickly.
