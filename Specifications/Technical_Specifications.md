## Structuring data

We need to represent the wine tanks. This needs to be fast to access and to write. We will be using the folowing representation.

<table>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Int *(Tank Volume)*</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
           <table>
             <tbody>
               <tr>
                 <td>
                   Hex *(Wine ID)*
                 </td>
                 <td>
                   Hex *(Wine ID)*
                 </td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                 <td>
                   Int *(Wine Volume)*
                 </td>
                 <td>
                   Int *(Wine Volume)*
                 </td>
               </tr>
             </tbody>
           </table>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Bool *(Empty of Full)*</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

- An Array of size ``n``, with ``n`` being the number of tanks 

In each meber of the array will be an array of size 3 storing :
- The tank volume
- The status (full or empty) as a bool for faste read
- A dynamic array

In the dynamic array we will store an array of size 2 with :
- An identifier for the wine (probably in Hex)
- The quantity of this wine in the tank


## Program

Wow much equation, such math

Basicaly :

For loop to see which tanks are full, and sort them by formulae.
Calculate the total volume of combining two formulae
Find wich cobinaison of container can hold the total volume
Split into the corect proportion
Repeat
