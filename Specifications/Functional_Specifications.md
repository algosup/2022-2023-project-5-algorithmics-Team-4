## I. Introduction

The main objective of this project is to build a software who determine the quantities of champagne in the correct proportions for the blending of the Krug Grande Cuvée. Our client for this project is the Champagne House Krug.

### 1. Purpose of the document

The Functional Specification Document is a document that provides detailed information on how the system solution will function and the requested behavior. Included in this document will be the detailed functional requirements.
This document will be updated as needed throughout the project to reflect any changes to the system solution.

### 2. Project Scope

The main feature of this software is the following:
Depending of pre-entered quantities and with a formula, the software will calculate the correct proportions of Champagne to blend in order to obtain the Krug Grande Cuvée.

There are the requirements for the software:

- [ ] No crash and bugs
- [ ] We must not have half empty tanks, oxidation will make the champagne unusable
- [ ] The final result must be the closest possible to the formula
- [ ] The code must be commented and in an idiomatic style to be easily readable
- [ ] The result must be find with the minimum number of steps possible
- [ ] The code's execution time must be the fastest possible

### 4. Terms/Acronyms and Definitions

| **Term** | **Acronym(if applicable)** | **Definition** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Champagne | | Sparkling wine produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France following rules that demand secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation. |
| Krug Grande Cuvée | | The flagship of the House, the Grande Cuvée is the archetype of Krug’s philosophy of craftsmanship and savoir faire: a blend of more than 120 wines from ten or more different years. |
| Tank | | A large receptacle or storage chamber, especially for liquid or gas. |

### 5. Risk and Assumptions

| **Risk** | **Impact** | **Mitigation** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| The software is not finished on time | The client will not be able to use the software and will have to do the blending manually | We will have to work more to finish the software on time |
| The software is not working | The client will not be able to use the software and will have to do the blending manually | We will have to work more to fix the bugs |
| The software is not user friendly | The client will not be able to use the software and will have to do the blending manually | We will have to work more to solve this problem |
| The formula is not close to the final result | The client will not be able to use the software and will have to do the blending manually | We will have to redefine our calculations |
| The result is letting some tank partially empty | Champagne will be lost | We will have to redefine our calculations |
